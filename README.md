# mupen64launcher

This is a quick and dirty frontend for the Nintendo 64 emulator, mupen64plus.
Running it requires at least Perl 5 with perl-tk library on Linux (UNIX).

The script assumes your Nintendo 64 roms are located in %HOME%/games/N64.
This may be changed by editing the launcher config in the script.
